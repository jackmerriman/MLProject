Dublin Bikes Machine Learning by Caitlín Cooney and Jack Merriman

Chosen Tasks:

	1. To assess the impact of the pandemic on the city-bike usage;

	2. To estimate how the city-bike usage would have been without the pandemic (e.g., 2020).

Chosen Stations:

	- Phibsborough Road

	- Merrion Square South

	- Royal Hospital
	
Division of work:

	- Jack:
	
		- Data pre-processing		
		- Summary visualisations
		- Task 1 visualisation and interpretation
		- Task 2 forecasting and visualisation
	
	- Caitlín
	
		- Kmeans clustering
		- Task 1 modelling
		- Task 2 modelling and testing

# Workflow:

Data Processing:
	
	- Download data and wrangle it to relevant columns and stations (DONE)

	- Determine the 'bike usage' feature which will be our outcome variable (DONE)

	- Examine post-2020 data for the impact of the pandemic

Model:

	- Determine model features for counterfactual forecast

	- Split data into training and testing sets


Data Visualisation:

	- Create visualisations for pandemic impact

	- Create visualisation to illustrate model predictions

Compilation:

	- Write report

		- Justification for station selection (Kmeans)

		- Data Pre-processing

		- Task 1
		
		- Task 2

Bonus:

	- Add measures of covid restrictions as a model feature
